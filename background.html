<p>Hello hii everyone.The oldest classical British and Latin writing had little or no 
space between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time,
 text direction (left to right) became standardized. Word dividers and terminal punctuation became
 common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an 
 underscore at the beginning of the new group.[1] The Greek parágraphos evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen 
 inserted inline between sentences.
